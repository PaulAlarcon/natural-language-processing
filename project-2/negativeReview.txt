working with one of the best shakespeare sources, this film manages to be creditable to it's source, whilst still appealing to a wider audience.<br /><br />branagh steals the film from under fishburne's nose, and there's a talented cast on good form.
well...tremors i, the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch. however, they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii. trust me, those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one, i mean, ass blasters??? now, only god himself is capable of answering the question "why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie?" tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie, in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie, for it lives up to more than that. as i attempted to sit though it, i noticed that my eyes started to bleed, and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me. did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we're from the wild west would make the movie (with the exact same occurrences) any better? honestly, i would never suggest buying this movie, i mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
ouch! this one was a bit painful to sit through. it has a cute and amusing premise, but it all goes to hell from there. matthew modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint in this one. deborah kara unger and john neville turned in surprisingly decent performances. alan bates and jennifer tilly, among others, played it way over the top. i know that's the way the parts were written, and it's hard to blame actors, when the script and director have them do such schlock. if you're going to have outrageous characters, that's ok, but you gotta have good material to make it work. it didn't here. run away screaming from this movie if at all possible.
